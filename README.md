## HiraKata - Work in Progress (WIP)

This application is currently a **Work in Progress (WIP)**. At the moment, it includes the following features:

- **Hiragana Table**: A complete reference table for all Hiragana characters, including basic characters, dakuten („Çõ), handakuten („Çú), and combinations (e.g., „Åç„ÇÉ, „Åç„ÇÖ, „Åç„Çá).

</div>

<br/>

- **Random Hiragana Quiz**: A simple quiz mode where you can test your knowledge of Hiragana characters. The quiz randomly selects characters from the Hiragana table, including variations, to help you practice recognition and recall.

### Planned Features:
- **Katakana Support**: In the near future, the app will include a Katakana table and a random quiz mode for Katakana, similar to the current Hiragana implementation.
- **Kanji Learning**: Once the Hiragana and Katakana features are fully developed, the app will expand to include Kanji characters, starting with the most basic ones and gradually introducing more complex characters.
- **Additional Activities**: Beyond quizzes, the app will incorporate various learning methods such as flashcards, writing practice, and spaced repetition to enhance your learning experience.
- **Gamification**: Earn points, unlock achievements, and track your progress as you master each syllabary and Kanji set.

### Why WIP?
This app is being developed iteratively to ensure a high-quality learning experience. Your feedback is invaluable! If you have suggestions or encounter any issues, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub or contact me directly.
